## Analytics (Concept)

### Cards
- Uploaded: count of non‑deleted files
- Downloaded: sum of `download_count`
- Deleted: soft‑deleted files
- Active Days: unique days with activity

### Charts
- Storage Usage Over Time
  - Daily MB added, with 3‑day moving average (and optional 7‑day)
- Storage Composition
  - Pie: Categories (Documents, Photos, Videos, Others)
  - Toggle: Top file types by % (top five in panels)
- Uploads Over the Year
  - Weekly bars with optional 4‑week average
- Uploads by Category (7 days)
  - Stacked bars by category per day

### Data Source
All visuals are computed from the files endpoint and simple server summaries. The goal is to demonstrate variety and consistency, not BI‑grade analytics.
