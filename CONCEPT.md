## KellyCloud — Concept Overview

KellyCloud is a design-and-prototype exploration of a modern, desktop‑first cloud storage dashboard. It demonstrates:

- A clean SaaS layout and brand treatment
- iCloud‑style storage visualization with real category logic (Documents, Photos, Videos, Others)
- Simple analytics surfaced from a REST API
- Practical UX choices for search, date presets, downloads, and soft deletion

This repository is intentionally a concept, not a production service. It’s meant to showcase information architecture, interaction patterns, and design polish that can be adapted into a real product.

### Concept Principles
- Desktop‑first: prioritize clarity, density, and efficiency over mobile layouts
- Familiar metaphors: segmented storage bars, file tables, pie/stacked charts
- Honest controls: sharp, consistent buttons; minimal states; clear toggles
- Color discipline: single palette across dashboard and analytics

### What’s Included
- Static frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) and demo API shape (Django/DRF scaffolding)
- Realistic features like downloads with original filenames and soft delete
- Analytics examples (cards + charts) driven by file data

### What’s Out of Scope
- Production hardening (auth providers, scaling, rate limiting, multi‑tenant concerns)
- Mobile layout and accessibility audits
- Payments/billing, teams/roles, or collaboration mechanics
