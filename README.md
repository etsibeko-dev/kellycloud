# ‚òÅÔ∏è KellyCloud

> Seamless, secure cloud ‚Äî blazing‚Äëfast uploads, effortless sharing, bank‚Äëgrade protection, 99.99% uptime, and real human support.

> **Forked cloud storage platform** with major UI/UX and functionality improvements by [@etsibeko-dev](https://github.com/etsibeko-dev)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Notice

**üöß This project is currently under active development and is NOT production-ready.**

This is a **forked contribution** where I'm exploring how far I can push the concept of a modern cloud storage platform. As a contributor, I've made significant improvements to the UI, functionality, and overall user experience, but this project serves as a **proof of concept** and **learning exercise**.

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ **Major UI/UX Overhaul** - Modern SaaS-style dashboard with cloud-themed styling
- ‚úÖ **Functionality Enhancements** - Better authentication, file management, and validation
- üö´ **Mobile Responsiveness** - Desktop-only for now; mobile is not planned by maintainer (contributions welcome)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Features** - Missing security hardening, performance optimization, and production deployment features
- üîÑ **Ongoing Development** - Continuously adding new features and improvements

**This project is for educational purposes and concept demonstration only.**

### üéØ Contribution Goals:
This fork represents my exploration of modern web development practices, where I'm challenging myself to see how far I can take a cloud storage concept. The focus is on:
- **Learning & Experimentation** - Trying new UI/UX patterns and development techniques
- **Best Practices** - Implementing clean code, modern frameworks, and user-centered design
- **Concept Validation** - Testing ideas for what makes a great cloud storage experience
- **Skill Development** - Pushing boundaries in both frontend and backend development

### üîÆ Future Vision:
While this project may never become a full production service, it serves as a foundation for understanding what it takes to build modern SaaS applications and exploring the possibilities of cloud storage platforms.

**Original Project**: This is a fork of the original KellyCloud project by [COSTA300](https://github.com/COSTA300/kellycloud). Built with Django REST Framework and vanilla JavaScript, featuring user authentication, file upload, subscription management, and a clean, responsive design.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Improvements

### üé® **Modern UI/UX Design**
- **Professional KellyCloud Theme** - Complete design system with color palette, typography, and spacing
- **iCloud-Style Storage Visualization** - Segmented progress bars with file type breakdown (Documents, Photos, Videos, Others)
- **Desktop-First Layout** - Designed for desktop screens; on small screens a friendly overlay is shown; mobile work not planned (PRs welcome)
- **Professional Components** - Equal height cards, consistent button styling, modern dropdowns

### üìÅ **Advanced File Management**
- **Multi-file Upload** - Real file storage with proper validation
- **Download System** - File downloads with download count tracking and correct filenames
- **Soft Deletion** - Files marked as deleted but preserved for analytics and recovery
- **File Categorization** - Automatic categorization by file type with color coding
- **Real-time Data Display** - Actual file sizes, upload dates, and metadata
- **Table Search** - Filter by filename or type (debounced input)
- **Date Presets** - Quick filters: All time, 7 days, 30 days, 6 months, 1 year

### üìä **Analytics & Insights**
- **Real-time Analytics** - Upload, download, and deletion tracking
- **Interactive Charts** - Storage usage visualization with Chart.js
- **User Activity Metrics** - Active days, file statistics, and usage patterns

#### How Analytics Works
- **Data source**: The frontend fetches your actual files from `GET /api/files/` and summary metrics from `GET /api/analytics/`. File downloads are streamed from `GET /api/files/<id>/download/` and increment `download_count` server‚Äëside. Deletions are soft deletes via `DELETE /api/files/<id>/` and are reflected in analytics.
- **Key metrics (cards)**:
  - **Uploaded**: Count of non‚Äëdeleted files you have uploaded.
  - **Downloaded**: Sum of `download_count` across your files.
  - **Deleted**: Count of files with `is_deleted = true` (soft‚Äëdeleted).
  - **Active Days**: Number of distinct calendar days on which you performed an action (upload/download/delete).
- **Storage Usage Over Time (chart)**:
  - Daily series shows MB added per day from real file `upload_date` and `size`.
  - Line chart with optional **7‚Äëday moving average** toggle (3‚Äëday MA is always included in code for smoothing).
  - Auto-refresh: analytics re-polls every 60s when the section is visible.
- **Storage Composition (pie)**:
  - Dropdown to switch between **Categories** (Documents, Photos, Videos, Others) and **Top 10 Types** by space.
  - Uses actual uploaded files; e.g., a large `.AppImage` is grouped under Others.
- **Uploads Over the Year**: 52‚Äëweek bar chart with optional **4‚Äëweek moving average** overlay.
- **Uploads by Category (7 days)**: Stacked bars by file category for the last 7 days.
- **Storage Breakdown (panel)**: Shows the top 5 file types by percentage with mini progress bars.
- **Recent Activity**: Always shows five rows; placeholders fill if there are fewer events.

##### Current vs Planned Analytics Visuals
- ‚úÖ Implemented:
  - Storage Usage Over Time with moving average (3‚Äëday base, 7‚Äëday toggle)
  - Storage Composition pie with dropdown: Categories vs Top 10 Types
  - Uploads Over the Year (52‚Äëweek) with 4‚Äëweek MA
  - Uploads by Category (last 7 days) stacked bars
  - Recent Activity fixed at five items; Storage Breakdown top five types
- üß≠ Roadmap (planned):
  - Cumulative area chart (total used over time)
  - Weekly uploads heatmap calendar (replacing legacy mock)
  - Per‚Äëtype daily stacked bars beyond 7‚Äëday window

### üì± Mobile/Small‚ÄëScreen Policy

This project intentionally targets desktop screens. The maintainer does not plan to build a mobile layout at this time.
- For viewports below 992px, the app hides the dashboard/sidebar and shows a friendly overlay explaining that mobile is not supported yet.
- This avoids broken layouts and unexpected interactions on phones.
- Contributions to add a proper mobile/responsive experience are welcome.

Key CSS hooks:
- `.small-screen-message` overlay with `@media (max-width: 992px)` to toggle visibility.
- High z-index on date picker (Flatpickr) to ensure it overlays without pushing content.

### üßæ Recent Changes (Changelog)

- iCloud‚Äëstyle storage bar with legend and detailed breakdown.
- File categorization audited; large binaries (e.g., `.AppImage`) rolled into Others.
- Real download tracking with original filenames via `Content-Disposition` (CORS exposed).
- Soft delete; lists and analytics filter `is_deleted`.
- Analytics auto‚Äërefresh and new charts: Composition dropdown, Uploads by Category, Yearly Uploads trend.
- Recent Activity always five rows; Storage Breakdown shows top five types by percent.
- My Files toolbar: date presets only, unified control heights, improved spacing; Upload moved to Upload page.
- Download/Delete buttons in KellyCloud style with sharp edges, equal widths, and spacing.
- Removed redundant ‚ÄúFile Categories‚Äù section; simplified chart controls; cache‚Äëbusting for `main.js`.
 - Branding polish: added SVG favicon; unified header spacing; gradient brand text next to logo; professional tab titles (`KellyCloud ‚Äî Page`).

### üîê **Enhanced Security & Authentication**
- **Token-based Authentication** - Secure login/logout with session management
- **Input Validation** - Real-time email and password validation with visual feedback
- **Password Visibility Toggles** - Eye icons for showing/hiding passwords

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/etsibeko-dev/kellycloud.git
   cd kellycloud
   ```
   
   > **Note**: This is a fork of the original [COSTA300/kellycloud](https://github.com/COSTA300/kellycloud) repository with improvements.

2. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd main
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   python3 -m http.server 3000
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   
   > **Note**: The backend root URL (`http://localhost:8000/`) will show a 404 error - this is expected! The backend is API-only and serves endpoints under `/api/`.
