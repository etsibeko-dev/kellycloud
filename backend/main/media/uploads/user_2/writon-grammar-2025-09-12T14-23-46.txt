Title: Da Dog Who Think It Was a Airplane

okay so like i was sitting on the ground but also not the ground like, a chair but low one, it broken kinda but still sittable if you balance correct which i do because i’m master of chairs sometimes, an anyway there’s this dog, right? but not like dog dog, but DOG dog. huge ears, tail like a mop that been through emotional damage, he just standing there like he ready for life but life not ready for he.

he look at me. i look at him. and he say “woof” but not normal woof, it was like woOoOoFfff, echoing into my heart meats. i feeled that. so i says to him, “yo dog what’s good wit u” and he says nothing, because he a dog but i feel like he knew the question was bigger than the answer so we just stared for a while like an old tv that stuck on the same channel forever.

then outta nowhere he start running in circles like he trying to charge up, like he bout to fly. i says to him “you bout to ascend bro?” and he bark once, just once, like YES. so i stood up too fast, head go light like balloon in wrong atmosphere and i stumble, hit my foot on a rock that wasn’t there before, swear to you, rock just materialized for violence.

but dog? he didn’t care. dog was already lifting off ground slightly, like wind underneath him but no wind anywhere, not even a breeze just ambition. ears flapping, tail spinning like a fan from dollar store and suddenly this mf fly. i mean for real. not high, not far, but he off ground and that counts.

now here where it get weird (yes, now)

sky? purple. not dark purple, just confused purple, like sky tryna be art. bird flying backwards. clouds dripping like they melting. i look around, now 3 more dogs flying. different breeds. one chihuahua with goggles. one pitbull with small jetpack that look like it made of pringles cans. one of them mighta been a raccoon but we not sure, didn’t ask.

i yell “YALL DOGS GOT A MISSION OR SUM?” and they ignore me but i hear music, like kazoo mixed with gospel. very spiritual but also extremely off key. i follow the sound, of course, because what else you do when the sky melty and dogs got aviation certifications.

then i see it. big building made of bread. actual bread. rye probably, maybe sourdough but i not no expert. windows made of cheese. flying dogs all landing there, real organized like they had a union. i try go in but squirrel with tie stop me say “you ain’t got clearance”

i say “CLEARANCE FOR WHAT” and squirrel say “CLEARANCE FOR AIRSPACE MEETING” and i say “i’m with da mop tail dog” and squirrel blink 5 times too fast and go “proceed”

so i in. inside smell like old libraries and toaster strudels. walls made of waffles. inside is full of animals all wearing little hats. important hats. council hats. one duck got monocle. one pig got a laptop and typing with nose. they all look serious, like big problems being solved in silly rooms.

then, guess who walk in. yup. mop tail dog. he got medals now. where he get medals? unknown. maybe earned them in past life. he nod at me, like "i brought u here for reason"

he walk to front, stand on stack of pizza boxes (pepperoni), clears his throat (yes, he clears throat) and begins:

“bark... bark bark... awoooooo...”

whole room silent.

then everyone claps. clapping like he gave best speech in centuries. duck throw flower. pig cry. squirrel salute.

i clap too but i don’t know why. felt right. heart warm. maybe this is diplomacy.

after speech, mop tail dog come to me and say (telepathically maybe): “the sky not what it used to be. birds lost they ways. cats plotting again. we need ground-dwellers like you”

i’m like “bruh i don’t even got health insurance” and he laugh. first time i ever seen dog laugh with just eyes. deep eyes. past lives type eyes.

next thing i know i’m wearing goggles. they don’t fit but they on. raccoon hand me clipboard say “sign here and here and once in invisible ink too”

i sign. ink disappears. raccoon nod.

they take me outside, give me hoverboard made of lasagna (don’t ask), and mop tail dog fly beside me. we zoom into horizon, which is just giant soup bowl now.

soup made of alphabet letters. floating words like “destiny” “caution” and “socks”

sky back to blue now. sun winking. clouds doing yoga.

to this day, i don’t know if it happen or dream or if i just ate a bad sandwich and passed out behind arby’s. but i still got goggles. and i still hear kazoo gospel sometimes when microwave hits exactly 4:44.

so maybe real. maybe not.

but next time you see a dog staring at clouds too long — don’t interrupt. he might be calculating the wind.

or remembering the war.

Title: The Dog Who Thought It Was an Airplane

Okay, so like I was sitting on the ground but also not on the ground, like a chair, but a low one; it was broken, kinda, but still sittable if you balanced correctly, which I do because I'm a master of chairs sometimes. Anyway, there was this dog, right? But not like a dog, a dog, but a DOG dog. Huge ears, a tail like a mop that had been through emotional damage. He was just standing there like he was ready for life, but life wasn't ready for him.

He looked at me. I looked at him. And he said, "Woof," but not a normal woof; it was like woOoOoFfff, echoing into my heart. I felt that. So I said to him, "Yo, dog, what's good with you?" And he said nothing, because he's a dog, but I felt like he knew the question was bigger than the answer, so we just stared at each other for a while, like an old TV that was stuck on the same channel forever.

Then, out of nowhere, he started running in circles like he was trying to charge up, like he was about to fly. I said to him, "You're about to ascend, bro?" And he barked once, just once, like yes. So I stood up too fast, my head went light, like a balloon in the wrong atmosphere, and I stumbled, hit my foot on a rock that wasn't there before – I swear to you, the rock just materialized for violence.

But the dog didn't care. The dog was already lifting off the ground slightly, like wind was underneath him, but there was no wind anywhere, not even a breeze, just ambition. His ears were flapping, his tail was spinning like a fan from a dollar store, and suddenly this guy was flying. I mean, for real. Not high, not far, but he was off the ground, and that counts.

Now, here's where it gets weird (yes, now).

The sky was purple. Not dark purple, just confused purple, like the sky was trying to be art. A bird was flying backwards. The clouds were dripping like they were melting. I looked around, and now there were three more dogs flying. Different breeds. One chihuahua with goggles. One pitbull with a small jetpack that looked like it was made of Pringles cans. One of them might have been a raccoon, but we weren't sure, we didn't ask.

I yelled, "Y'all dogs got a mission or something?" And they ignored me, but I heard music – like a kazoo mixed with gospel. Very spiritual, but also extremely off-key. I followed the sound, of course, because what else do you do when the sky is melty and dogs have aviation certifications?

Then I saw it. A big building made of bread. Actual bread. Rye, probably, maybe sourdough – but I'm no expert. The windows were made of cheese. The flying dogs all landed there, really organized, like they had a union. I tried to go in, but a squirrel with a tie stopped me and said, "You don't have clearance."

I said, "Clearance for what?" And the squirrel said, "Clearance for airspace meeting." I said, "I'm with the mop-tail dog." And the squirrel blinked five times too fast and said, "Proceed."

So I went in. Inside, it smelled like old libraries and toaster strudels. The walls were made of waffles. Inside, there were animals all wearing little hats. Important hats. Council hats. One duck had a monocle. One pig had a laptop and was typing with its nose. They all looked serious, like big problems were being solved in silly rooms.

Then, guess who walked in. Yup. The mop-tail dog. He had medals now. Where he got the medals? Unknown. Maybe he earned them in a past life. He nodded at me, like, "I brought you here for a reason."

He walked to the front, stood on a stack of pizza boxes (pepperoni), cleared his throat (yes, he cleared his throat), and began:

"Bark... Bark bark... Awoooooo..."

The whole room was silent.

Then everyone clapped. Clapping like he gave the best speech in centuries. The duck threw a flower. The pig cried. The squirrel saluted.

I clapped too, but I didn't know why. It felt right. My heart was warm. Maybe this was diplomacy.

After the speech, the mop-tail dog came to me and said (telepathically, maybe): "The sky isn't what it used to be. Birds have lost their ways. Cats are plotting again. We need ground-dwellers like you."

I said, "Bruh, I don't even have health insurance." And he laughed. First time I ever saw a dog laugh with just his eyes. Deep eyes. Past lives type eyes.

The sky was back to blue now. The sun was winking. The clouds were doing yoga.

To this day, I don't know if it happened or if it was a dream or if I just ate a bad sandwich and passed out behind Arby's. But I still have goggles. And I still hear kazoo gospel sometimes when my microwave hits exactly 4:44.

So maybe it was real. Maybe it wasn't.

But next time you see a dog staring at clouds too long – don't interrupt. He might be calculating the wind.
