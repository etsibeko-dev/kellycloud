Title: The Day The Cat Find the Trouble

So it was like one of them day where the sun just not want to shine properly, like it was confused or maybe tired, nobody know for sure but you could just feel it, you know? The street was wet not from the rain but maybe someone leave the sprinkler on or maybe a pipe bursted somewhere, that stuff don’t really matter much to me because I was more thinking about what happen yesterday, or maybe it was day before, I don’t remember exact, time be blurring together sometimes when you got a lot on your mind and little sleep on your bed.

So I’m walking down this street with no name, not that it don’t got one, it do probably but the sign was missing so I call it the nameless street, sounds mysterious and also nobody can correct me. Then the cat come out of nowhere. I don’t own a cat. I don’t even like cats much because they sneaky and they stare too long, like they looking into your thoughts or something, like what you hiding from them? But this cat, it wasn’t just any cat, it had a weird walk, like it was limping but not really, more like pretending to limp but for who? Ain’t nobody around but me and it.

So I say, “What you doing cat?” And it meows but like in a sarcastic way, if that even possible for a cat, which I didn’t think was until then. So it walks off and I, for some reason I can’t explain and won’t try to, I follow it. You ever follow a animal you don’t know into a place you ain’t been before? If yes, you probably understand. If no, don’t judge.

It lead me to this backyard that I ain’t seen before but probably was there the whole time, that’s how backyards work. Fences was falling apart like they just gave up on standing, gate was squeeky like in horror movies when they wanna tell you “hey don’t come in here,” but I did anyway cause the cat did. Inside was junk, but not regular junk, like weird junk, like maybe someone collect garbage but only the interesting pieces. Like there was a broken keyboard with no keys and a TV with a screen that got a hole in it but the rest was fine. Who punches a TV screen and leave the rest alone?

The cat jumps on the table, then the table wobble cause it only got 3 legs and one was replaced with like, a mop stick or maybe a leg from a chair, not sure but it didn’t match. Then this lady comes out from the backdoor, and she got the wildest hair you ever seen. Not wild like messy, but wild like it got opinions and don’t listen to her. She look at me and say “You seen the truth yet?” and I say “I just followed the cat.” She laugh like I said the funniest joke in the world and I wasn’t trying to be funny but now I felt like maybe I was.

Then she sit down and the cat jumps in her lap like they do this every day, which maybe they do. She start talking but not to me, more like just saying stuff like it was her thoughts leaking out loud. She say “people think time move straight, but it don’t, it jump and skip and sometimes it dance backwards,” and I’m like, okay... I didn’t sign up for no science lesson but here I am.

Then she says “you here for the box, ain’t you?” and I say “what box?” cause really I ain’t know nothing about no box and she smile like “aha got you.” She go into the house and come back with a box. Not a big one, not small neither, just a box. Brown, dusty, with a sticker on the side that say “FRAGILE” but it was spelled wrong, like “FRAJIL” or something. She hands it to me and I didn’t want to take it but I also didn’t want to not take it cause now I was curious and I hate being curious with no answers.

So I hold the box and it feel heavy, but not like physically heavy but like emotionally heavy, like it got stuff inside that ain’t got weight but got meaning, you get what I mean? Probably not but anyway. I open it cause why wouldn’t I and inside was a mirror. Just a mirror. Cracked down the middle like a lightning bolt hit it but otherwise clean, not dusty like the outside. I look into it and I don’t see me, I see the cat.

But not just the cat, like hundreds of the same cat. All doing different things like one walking, one sitting, one licking itself (gross), one jumping, one sleeping, one meowing (of course). Then I blink and now it’s just me again. I close the box cause now I feel like maybe I seen too much. She nod like “yea, it do that sometimes” and I’m like “what even is this?”

She don’t answer me direct, just says “Now you know what you didn’t know before. That’s the point.” Which, by the way, is not helpful at all but somehow made sense. The cat jump off her lap and back onto the ground and it look at me like “come on then,” so I follow again.

We leave the backyard, don’t say goodbye cause it ain’t that type of visit I guess. The air feel different, like thicker or maybe I’m just more aware of it. I don’t even remember walking home, just was there all of a sudden, holding a box that I ain’t sure even exists anymore cause when I open it again later, it’s just empty.

No mirror. No cat. No truth. Just me.

And from that day, things been weird. Not bad, just weird. Like I’ll hear a meow in places where ain’t no cats, or I’ll see a flash of fur in my peripheral vision and when I turn, nothing. Also clocks stop sometimes when I pass by. Not all clocks, just some. Maybe broken, maybe not.

Anyways, I stop following strange cats now. But sometimes I think maybe I was the one being followed the whole time.
