--- Original Text ---
A man recounts a surreal experience involving a dog that could fly.  The dog, with a mop-like tail, took off, revealing a bizarre world with a purple sky, backward-flying birds, and other flying dogs. They all convened at a bread building with cheese windows, where the mop-tail dog gave a speech to an assembly of animals in hats.  The man was then recruited, given goggles and a lasagna hoverboard, and joined the flying dogs, soaring towards a soup bowl horizon filled with alphabet letters. The narrator concludes by questioning the reality of the event, but retains the goggles and sometimes hears kazoo gospel music.
